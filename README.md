# CSC Lesson Notebooks

A repository for student versions of course Jupyter notebooks.

In case you use this repository for your course materials please add a separate branch for it. Currently, this repository has
lesson materials for following courses / branches:

 - Spatial Data Science for Sustainable Development -course (2021) --> `sustainability-gis-2021`
 - Spatial analytics -course (2021) --> `spatial-analytics-2021`

## How to organize the notebooks?

1. Create a branch for your course/year (e.g. `spatial-analytics-2021`)
2. Inside that branch, add a folder for your course (e.g. `/spatial-analytics`) and add your notebooks to this folder, e.g. like this:

```
notebooks/
    spatial-analytics/
        Lesson-1/
            L1-notebook.ipynb
        Lesson-2/
            L2-notebook.ipynb
        etc.
```
