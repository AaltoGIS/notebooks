# CSC Lesson Notebooks

A repository for student versions of course Jupyter notebooks.

## How to organize the notebooks?

- add a folder for your course (e.g. `/spatial-analytics`) and add your notebooks to this folder, e.g. like this:

```
notebooks/
    spatial-analytics/
        Lesson-1/
            L1-notebook.ipynb
        Lesson-2/
            L2-notebook.ipynb
        etc.
```
