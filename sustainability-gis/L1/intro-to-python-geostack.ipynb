    "## Fundamental library: Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, the most often used Python package that you will learn is [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/). Geopandas makes it possible to work with geospatial data in Python in a relatively easy way. Geopandas combines the capabilities of the data analysis library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) with other packages like [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) and [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) for managing spatial data. The main data structures in geopandas are `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` which extend the capabilities of `Series` and `DataFrames` from pandas. In case you wish to have additional help getting started with pandas, we recommend you to take a look lessons 5 and 6 from the openly available [Geo-Python -course](geo-python.github.io). The main difference between GeoDataFrames and pandas DataFrames is that a [GeoDataFrame](http://geopandas.org/data_structures.html#geodataframe) should contain (at least) one column for geometries. By default, the name of this column is `'geometry'`. The geometry column is a [GeoSeries](http://geopandas.org/data_structures.html#geoseries) which contains the geometries (points, lines, polygons, multipolygons etc.) as shapely objects. \n",

Also in this course, we will use OSM data frequently. Hence, let's see how we can retrieve data from OSM using a library called [pyrosm](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). With `pyrosm` you can easily download and extract data from anywhere in the world based on OSM.PBF files that are distributed e.g. by [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/). The tool aims to be an efficient way to parse OSM data covering large geographical areas (such as countries and cities), but as a downside, it is a bit limited in a sense how you can define your area of interest. With `pyrosm` you can extract OSM data from 654 regions in the world (covering all countries plus many city regions, see [docs for further info](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#available-datasets)).\n",

    "Perfect! Now it is much easier to understand our map because the roads brought much more context (assuming you know Helsinki). We ware able to add the roads to the same map by specifying the `ax` parameter to point to the axis that we received when first plotting the `join2` (i.e. selected buildings). In a similar manner, you can add as many layers in your map as you wish. Let's still do a small visual trick and specify that the background color in our map is black instead of white. This can be done easily by changing the `style` of matplotlib visualization renderer:"
